    <img src="mushroom.jpg" alt="mushroom">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This puff pastry mushroom tart is earthy, aromatic, and savory with an upscale look, 
        yet quick and uncomplicated to prepare using puff pastry. 
        Delicious served with a cup of soup or salad, 
        it's also a great appetizer when cut into smaller pieces.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces cremini mushrooms, such as Baby Bella®</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, sliced vertically</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 (17.3 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1/2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, or as needed for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cut mushrooms into 1/4-inch-thick slices (don’t cut too thinly).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are golden and onions are soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in soy sauce, thyme, and garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Unfold puff pastry sheet onto a lightly-floured work surface. Gently pat down or roll out dough with a rolling pin into a 10x10-inch square. Using a sharp knife, score a line about 1/2 inch from all edges to create a border, being careful not to cut all the way through. Use a fork to generously prick pastry sheet all over inside the border.</li>
        <li>Transfer puff pastry to the baking sheet, and brush the borders with beaten egg. Evenly spread Gruyere cheese inside the border, and top with mushroom mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake until tart is puffed and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Garnish with additional thyme, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
