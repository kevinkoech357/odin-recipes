    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. 
        The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, 
        fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.
